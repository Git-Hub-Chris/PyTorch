sphinx==5.0.0
# NB: Due to https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457, legacy -e will be deprecated
# in 2025 and we need to use pip install --use-pep517 -r requirements.txt to install
# this instead. Another approach is to update PyTorch pyproject.toml, but that change
# has a much wider implication than just installing doc build requirements

# but it doesn't seem to work and hangs around idly. The initial thought is probably
# something related to Docker setup. We can investigate this later
